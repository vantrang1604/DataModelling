Customer Churn Prediction Portfolio

1. Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using Machine Learning models. By analyzing customer purchasing behaviors and demographics, the goal is to classify customers into two groups: Churn and Non-Churn.

2. Research Question

How can customer purchasing behaviors and demographics be used to predict churn with high performance using different machine learning algorithms?

3. Agendas

a. Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning and exploring the dataset to identify patterns and trends.

b. Data Modeling:

Logistic Regression with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with GridSearch Cross-Validation

Classification using Gaussian Naive Bayes

c. Model Comparison:

Compare models based on performance metrics, with a focus on accuracy score as the primary metric.

d. Dataset Information

The dataset contains customer demographic and behavioral data.

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration

Handle missing values and outliers.

Perform feature engineering to enhance data quality.

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and correlations.

2. Modeling

Logistic Regression: Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important features.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearch Cross-Validation.

Gaussian Naive Bayes: Utilized for its simplicity and interpretability.

3. Model Evaluation

Compared models using accuracy as the primary performance metric.

Key Findings

Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 80.84%, making it the most effective model for this dataset.


4. Future Work

Explore additional models such as Decision Trees or Random Forests for comparison.

Use advanced feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.

Experiment with different evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for a more holistic view of model performance.
